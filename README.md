# Predicting Tech Sector Layoffs Using Time Series Analysis

## Project Description:

In this project, we delve into understanding and predicting layoffs in the tech sector using the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series analysis. The dataset contains daily layoffs from different tech companies. We analyze the number and percentage of layoffs and discuss their implications for various stakeholders in the tech sector.

## Libraries Used:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `pmdarima`
- `sklearn`

## Files in the Repository:

1. `README.md`: Provides a discussion on the motivation for the project, libraries used, files in the repository with a small description, and a summary of the results.

2. `Tech_Sector_Layoffs_Prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains all the Python code used for the analysis. It is well-documented with comments, analysis, and visualizations.

3. `layoff.csv`: This file contains the dataset used for this analysis can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022). It includes daily layoffs from different tech companies.

## Results Summary:

Our analysis led to several key findings:

- The tech sector shows a varied rate of layoffs across different industries.
- The time-series forecasts, although they should be interpreted with caution due to inherent uncertainties, provide valuable insights into potential future layoff trends.
- These findings can inform decision-making, guide policy development, and help organizations prepare for future trends in the tech sector.
